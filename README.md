PluXml to Pelican
=================

pluxml2pelican.py is a weblog migration tool to move from
[PluXml](http://www.pluxml.org) to [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com). 
I was not satisfied with Pelican's RSS import. So I decided to write a 
dedicated tool. It's probably not *the perfect* tool and it may not handle 
all cases but I think code is clear enough to be modified and improved.
